Adds missing type annotations to TypeScript code using static analysis.

> âš¡ðŸ’€ **Danger**: new and experimental; use at your own risk! ðŸ’€âš¡

## Why?

Stringent type safety from [`--noImplicitAny`](https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/docs/options/noImplicitAny.html)
and [`--strictNullChecks``](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-0.html) in TypeScript
are wonderful but can be difficult to add to large pre-existing projects.
Adding the new type annotations through hundreds or thousands of legacy files is tedious and time-consuming.

This package automagically adds those missing type annotations for you with configurable comment markers.
That can allow you to enable these stricter compiler flags for all code without changing the runtime of existing code.

For documentation on the types of mutations TypeStat applies, see [Mutations](./docs/Mutations.md).

> Protip: also take a look at [TypeWiz](https://github.com/urish/typewiz)!

## Usage

```shell
npm i -g typestat
```

You'll need to have the `"strictNullChecks"` option enabled via a `tsconfig.json`, either directly or with the superset `"strict"`.

```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "strictNullChecks": true
    }
}
```

### CLI

```shell
typestat
```

The `typestat` command uses [Cosmiconfig](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig)
to search for a `package.json` property or configuration file such as `typestat.json` for settings.

#### `-c`/`--config`

Path to a config file, if you'd like a custom path.

```shell
typestat --config typestat.custom.json
```

#### `-V`/`--version`

Run with `-V` or `--version` to print the package version.

```shell
typestat --version
```

### Node

```javascript
import { typeStat } from "typestat";

typeStat()
    .then(result => {
        if (result.succeeded) {
            console.log(`Successfully ran TypeStat.`);
        } else {
            console.error(`Failed running TypeStat: ${result.error}`);
        }
    });
```

`typeStat` can optionally take in a `{ config: string }` as an explicit configuration file path.

```javascript
await typeStat({
    config: "./typestat.custom.json",
});
```

## Options

All runtime options, such as for fixes or a `tsconfig.json` path, are expected to be in a `typestat.json` or [Cosmiconfig](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig) equivalent.

See `RawTypeStatOptions` in [`src/options/types.ts`](./src/options/types.ts).

### `include`

Globs of files to run on, if not everything in the TypeScript project.
Useful to only change some files at a time.

```json
{
    "include": [
        "src/experimental/**/*.ts"
    ]
}
```

### `projectPath`

Relative path to a TypeScript project.
Defaults to `"tsconfig.json"`.

```json
{
    "projectPath": "./tsconfig.custom.json"
}
```

### `typeAliases`

Object mapping names of added types to strings to replace them with.

For example, to replace `null` with `null /* TODO: check auto-generated types (thanks TypeStat!) */`:

```json
{
    "typeAliases": {
        "null": "null /* TODO: check auto-added types (thanks TypeStat!) */"
    }
}
```

## Development

After installing [Node >=8](https://nodejs.org/en/download), clone and install packages locally with:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/joshuakgoldberg/typestat
cd typestat
npm i
```

Compile with `npm run tsc`, lint with `npm run lint`, and run tests with `npm run test`.
Do all three with `npm run verify`.

### Why Not TSLint?

Or: why isn't this implemented as a set of [TSLint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint) rules?

Great question!
TSLint rules, even with [type checking](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/usage/type-checking), don't have access to the full [TypeScript language service](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Using-the-Language-Service-API).
This is by design for performance and reliability reasons.
TypeStat needs that service.

TSLint also has a [relatively unstable `--fix`](https://github.com/palantir/tslint/issues/2556) that can't handle multiple rounds of mutations.
TypeStat is built on [Automutate](https://github.com/automutate/automutate), which is more stable and allows multiple rounds.
