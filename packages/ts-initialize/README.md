## Usage

`ts-initialize` is a CLI tool to onboard an existing project onto TypeScript in as few changes as possible.
It will:

1. Create a TSConfig with settings tailored to your project
2. Rewrite any `require()`s as ESM `import`s
3. Rename your JavaScript files to the appropriate TypeScript extension
4. Rewrite extension-less `import`s to include an extension as needed
5. Rewrite import paths for situations where the type system explicitly needs extensions
6. Install `@types/` packages that exist for dependencies

<!-- 7. Add `: any` type annotations or `// @ts-expect-error` directives in remaining locations to prevent type errors -->

It will _not_:

- Modify the runtime behavior of your code
- Infer explicit type annotations _(use `ts-enhance` for that)_
- Augment configurations for common existing tools such as Babel and typescript-eslint _(yet!)_

‚ö° To start, the **`ts-initialize`** command will launch an interactive guide to setting up a configuration file. ‚ö°

```shell
npx ts-initialize
```

> ```shell
> üëã Welcome to ts-initialize! üëã
> ...
> ```

After running `ts-initialize`, use **[`ts-enhance`](../ts-enhance/README.md)** for improving the types in your code.
