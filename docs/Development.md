# Development

After installing [Node >=8](https://nodejs.org/en/download), clone and install packages locally with:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/joshuakgoldberg/typestat
cd typestat
npm i
```

Compile with `npm run tsc`, lint with `npm run lint`, and run tests with `npm run test`.
Do all three with `npm run verify`.
